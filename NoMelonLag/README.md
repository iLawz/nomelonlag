Github page for NoMelonLag spigot plugin

## Features
This plugin removes the need for redstone in melon/sugarcane farms. As soon as a melon/sugarcane block grows a check is performed whether its adjecent
to the 'harverster' block specified in the config (default is a piston head). <br> <br>
If the grown block is adjecent to the harvester block the melon/sugarcane is broken directly without the need for any redstone contraptions.
